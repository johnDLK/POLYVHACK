SAVE YOUR TIME. AND SAVE ELECTRICITY FOR MINING.


My mom is a healthcare worker who is about to retire, But her leader will ask her to take some unrelated exams, such as the Internet, AI, technological innovation, etc.
This is not environmentally friendly.
She can only ask me for help, I find the video play by HTML5 player, but I can't skip the video and it will be paused by a popup window for questions in class, so I have to watch the teaching video completely.
As a developer, I am curious how to achieve. The truth is a video product by POLYV, I read their code and documentation, and find out the hack way.
